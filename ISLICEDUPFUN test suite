# I: INPUTS INTO THE DEVICE
# These represent the ways you can interact and control the device. Including:
#  Built-in keyboard/keypad
#  Touch screen gestures and typing
#  Synching with other devices
#  Peripherals that you can plug in to the device
#  Hold the device differently when inputting – be creative!

# S: STORE
# See if you can find anything that might have been missed by looking for:
#  Submission specifications
#  Development guide
#  User guide for error handling, location services, permissions for user privacy items, accessibility, etc.

# L: LOCATION
# Where you are located can have an impact on what you are testing, particularly if the application requires an internet connection. 
# Applications may be affected by the following:
#  Geo-location errors
#  Movement, stopping suddenly
#  Connection issues due to interference
#  Moving from one data network to another (eg. wifi to wifi, wifi to wireless broadband, wireless broadband to wifi, others)

# I: INTERACTIONS/INTERRUPTIONS
# Are there problems when:
#  Running multiple applications, utilizing multitasking
#  Using other applications, then using the application you are testing(email, calendar, texting, note taking, others)
#  Notifications appear (new emails, phone calls, text messages, other notifications)
#  Error messages occur (losing connections, notifications, operating system and other errors)

# C: COMMUNICATION
# Smartphones started out primarily as communication devices, but the app we are testing may not handle
# communication interaction smoothly. Here are some communication examples:
#  Phone
#  Texting
#  Emails
#  Instant messaging
#  Voicemail messages
#  Video
#  Others

# E: ERGONOMICS
# They run into the same problems that can make you tired:
#  Small screens can be hard on the eyes
#  A small device means there is no ergonomic help from a desk, or chair – you often hunch
# over to interact with it
#  It’s not uncommon to get a sore back, fingers, eyes when using a device for any length of time
#  Use physical strain as points of investigation for usability problems

# D: DATA
# Check for:
#  Types of input – special characters, different languages, etc
#  Media – see if the app depends on an outside source to play music, videos or anything else.
#  Size of files – if the application uses outside files, try using different file types
#  Frequency of updates – some applications require data from a server that is updated
# periodically to change settings, or to provide new content. Find out the schedule of these
# updates and see how the application reacts when an update occurs.

# U: USABILITY
# When you are testing the application, note and log any issues that make
# you uncomfortable, frustrated, angry, or upset. To find usability issues, look for any actions that are
# awkward, confusing, or slow. Listen to your emotions – that’s an important source of usability issues.
# Instructions can be incomplete or misleading, items can be labeled incorrectly, and there may be
# workflows that make doing what you want to do difficult.

# P: PLATFORM
# You have little control over operating system updates. The provider encourages you to update
# these, for good reasons. However, new versions can cause an app to fail that worked in a prior version. Be
# aware that updates (even small ones) can cause an application to stop working. Be sure to find out all the
# technical information about what device you are using, and what operating system version you have
# installed when logging a bug.

# F: FUNCTION
# This can often be very simplistic: looking for items and ensuring they are there and function
# the way they are supposed to. To be more creative, generate test ideas by asking these questions:
#  Can you identify everything that the application does?
#  Have you worked through all the aspects of the app? Clicked every button? Filled in every
# form? Have looked into default settings and options that are available to you?.
#  Try a tour of the product to identify everything it does.
# Try to find commonly used features, and the most obscure. Be thorough.
#  Once you have a good sense of what the product is supposed to do, does it match what
# the app developers say it does? If it doesn’t, there is a source of problems. If your
# impression differs from theirs, they need to know that.

# U: USER SCENARIOS
# I try to think of real people and how they would react to using the
# software. To create scenarios, I identify the following
#  How is this application supposed to be used?
#  What problems does it solve for users?
#  What are the goals of end users that this application helps them solve?

# N: NETWORK
# In thesecases, the application may fail or crash because of timing issues (it takes too long to get responses) poor 
# connections (lack of signal strength) or moving from one network to another.
#  Wifi
#  Wireless broadband
#  Dead spots
#  Moving from one data network to another (eg. wifi to wifi, wifi to wireless broadband,
# wireless broadband to wifi, others)
